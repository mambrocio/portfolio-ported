It was something I made sometime ago for school as a requirement to help me possibly get an internship. I remember trying to get my portfolio into a better shape months after working on it, but at some point i just stopped coding in general. But now this year I'm going to redesign my portfolio and add new projects to make it stand out more and have more interesting content. Click on the image, it redirects to a deploying site.</p>
